### Foundations of Cybersecurity

I've explored the cybersecurity profession, including significant events that led to the development of the cybersecurity field and its continued importance to organizational operations. Learn about entry-level cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. I've explored the eight Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) security domains, various security frameworks and controls, as well as a foundational security model called the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. I also am introduced to some common tools used by security analysts that help protect organizations and people alike.

### Security Risk

Identify how cybersecurity professionals use frameworks and controls to protect business operations, and explore common cybersecurity tools. How to use security tools and audits helps protect assets and data. These are key concepts in the cybersecurity field, and understanding them helps keep organizations and people safe from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

### Networks and Network Security

Gain an understanding of network-level vulnerabilities and how to secure networks. I've develop a greater understanding of network architecture, operations, intrusion tactics, common types of network vulnerabilities and attacks, and how to secure networks. I've also be introduced to common network protocols, firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and system hardening practices.

### Linux and SQL

Foundational computing skills, including communicating with the Linux operating system through the command line and querying databases with SQL. I've learned foundational concepts related to understanding operating systems, communicating with the Linux operating system through commands, and querying databases with Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

The importance of security controls and developing a threat actor mindset to protect and defend an organizationâ€™s assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. I've explored many of the most common security controls used to protect valuable assets from risk. I also discover the variety of ways assets are vulnerable to threats by adopting an attacker mindset.

### Detection and Response

Understand the incident response lifecycle and practice using tools to detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Hands-on practice using resources like network protocol analyzers, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security information event management (SIEM) tools to capture network packets and analyze log data. 

### Automate Cybersecurity Task with Python

Python programming language and write code to automate cybersecurity tasks. Started with key foundational concepts in Python, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. Then develop functions in Python and work with string and list data in a variety of ways. Explore algorithms that involve importing and parsing files.
